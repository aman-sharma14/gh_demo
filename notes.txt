C# and Java    9
    - offers more datatype like int32, int 16 etc
        offers less, like int, long, double etc 
    - Software by miscrosoft
        software by Oracle (open source)
    - More control on inheritance. Its in detail, and method can be called at any step of the chain (using virtual, override etc)
        More straightforward, but offers less control
    - Automation library gets installed, so its slower
        only required libraries get installed, so faster
    - Delegates added to simplify progress development
        No Delegates
    -  diff ways of writing an array -> jagged, mulit-dim
        only standard arrays (no jagged)
    - OS level control given in .NET or C# (like file system, registry etc)
        more platform independent, thus avoids OS specific controls for portability
    - tightly integrated with Windows
        platform independent (runs anywhere with JVM)
    - integrates tightly with other .NET langs like VB.NET (must have .NET compiler)
        java-only environment


Main method - 
    entry point of C# console application or Windows application.
    when application started, main method is first method to be invoked
    Can only be one entry point i.e one main method in a C# program
    If more than one class with main, must compile with /main compiler option (command) to specify which main method to use as entry.
         eg 
        TestClass {
            static void Main(string[] args){
                System.Console.WriteLine(args.length);
            }

        OR 
        static void Main(){
            System.Console.WriteLine("No args Main method");
        }

        OR 
        static int Main(string[] args){
            System.Console.WriteLine("returning exit code");
            return 0;  // exit code
        }
    }

    why Main is static - 
        static methods are class level instances, so no need to create an instance to call the static method.
        Main is static cause it has to run when program starts and is the entry point and runs without creating an instance.
    String[] args - 
        allows to pass values from terminal , to program, when it runs


Inheritance - 
    OOPS feature, where child class can use or extend features of parent class
    virtual - means a method can be overridden, gives run time polymorphism (method overriding)
        expects subclass to override it, else, works like a normal function
    Override - 
        used to override a virtual method
        signature must match the base class method exactly
        Ensures runtime binding (decided at runtime which version to call).
    new - 
        when used, chain will stop right there
        as good as writing nothing in front of class, thus, its only a good practice
        hides the base class method (inside this class only, thus when you make its object, you get this class's method and not parent's)
        used when the child has method with same name as base class, but doesnt want to override
    
    CODE
        virtual needs override,
            if A (virtual) -> B (override) -> C (override)
            and A a = new C();
            op -> C's function
            but, chain will start from A

            so, if A (virtual) -> B (virtual) -> C (override)
                and A a = new C();
                op -> A's function
                as, chain will start from A, and end there, as it didnt find override 
        
        if a parent class has new func(), child cannot override
        Only use new, when we want to break chain

        so when,
        A obj = new D();
            A is reference type, D is type
            inheritance chain will start from A, and try to reach D via override
            if override not found at any step, i.e new/virtual method comes in between, chain will stop 
        subclass cannot have override , if its immediate parent does not have virtual
        

Constructor - 
    special method which invokes automatically when object created.
    Responsible for object initialization and memory allocation
    dont have return type
    can be overloaded
    Name is as same as class name
    compiler automatically creates default Constructor, if we dont
    there exists, always atleast one Constructor in class, and class can have any number of constructors
    eg - 
        class Sample{
            public Sample(){}
        }

    Types - 
        Default (by compiler) (or parameterless)
        Parameterized - 
            eg . 
            class Sample{
                public Sample(int a1){}
            }

        Copy - 
            Parameterized const which contains parameter of same class type.
            Main purpose is to initialize new instance with the values of an existing instance
            copies values from existing object
            eg - 
                public Student(Student s)
                {
                    this.Name = s.Name;
                    this.Age = s.Age;
                }

        Static - 
            invoked only once for any number of instances, i.e during creation of first instance or, first reference to a static member in class
            used to initialize static fields of class and to write code that needs to be executed only once
            will not have access modifier like private or public
            only one static const allowed
            wont accept any paramter, as its automatically called by CLR , thus cant be called manually
            eg - 
                static Sample(){
                    // do something 
                }

        Private - 
            Special instance constructor used in class, that contains static members only
            If class has a private, and no public constructor, then other classes are not allowed to create instance of this class
            Thus, neither its obj can be created, nor it can be inherited
            Main purpose is to restrict class from being instantiated when it has every member as static
            eg .
                private Sample() 
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("private Constructor called"); // This will never be printed
                    //can only be called within the class 
                }

                public static void func(string msg)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Static funation : " + msg);
                }
                can call func via objA.func() as its static
    :this() - used to call another constructor in same class
    see whatsapp example for code


XML - 9
    Extensible Markup language
    text based format, can be read by any platform
    it is lightweight
    conversion of XML to database and vice versa is easily possible
    works well for data exchange between systems
    .NET provides strong support for reading, writing and manipulating XML using XmlDocument, XmlReader etc 
    XML naturally supports nested data using parent-child relationship
    can convert objects to xml and store or transmit them
    can be used in REST API, thus in web services
    
    xml products CODE 


LDAP -
    lightweight directory access protocol
    protocol for accessing and managing directory services (specialized database optimized for reading/searching)
    it is databse optimized for reading, searching or browsing , not designed for frequent updates
    stores user credentials, organizational info, resource information in a Hierarchical structured (tree-like) format
    provides authentication, access control etc
    Eg - 
        used in router and switches, to validate admin access
    LDAP is not a general database. It’s a protocol to access a read-optimized directory that stores users, groups, and resources.


Components of .NET - 
    DIAGRAM
    CLS -
        Common Language Specification
        .NET supports 63 Languages, each has its own syntax, one lang doesnt support syntax of other,
            this means, .NET has common syntax feature which are supported by all 63 languages.
        specifies set of rules, that need to be athered by all language compilers, targeting CLR 
        It is subset of CTS 
    CTS - 
        Common Type System
        each language has its own data type system, one lang does not support datatype of another,
            .NET has common datatype features supported by all languages
        specifies data types that can be used in a language
        supports Value types(actual value, direct data) and reference types (pointers, reference to value's memory address)
    CLR - 
        Common Language Runtime
        provides environment to run all all .NET programs
        code running under CLR is called managed code.
        memory management - 
            cache is fastest memory
            CLR moves most used things to cache , so accessing them is faster
            for loop example with DIAGRAM
            thus, programmer dont need to worry about managing memory, as CLR provides memory and thread mngmt
        CLR allocates and deallocates memory based on scope (completed or running)
        language compilers convert code to MSIL, this will be converted to native code by CLR using JIT (DIAGRAM)
        CTS and CSL come under CLR

    Task Parallel Library - 
        decides which variables to seperate and perform task parallely to get quicker solutions
        helps divide code such that things can be done parallely
        things can be done parallely only when there is no dependency

    AJAX - 
        miscrosoft ajax (not web one)
        built in lib to make asynchronous calls without reload
        DIAGRAM
        form submission
            if one input fails validation, entire data gets rejected
            to validate data before submission, AJAX is used. Check data validation without reload, asynchronously
            can use any technique, web or miscrosoft
    FCL - 
        Framework Class Library or base class library
        common for all types of applications
            i.e accessing library classes and methods in VB.NET will be same in C# and other languages
        huge collection of prebuilt classes and interaces (file io, collections, networking, xml)
        
        WCF - 
            Windows Communication Foundation
            can send data as asynchronous messages (XML or binary data) from one service endpoint to another
            exchange data in real time
            offers maangeable way of creating web services with enhanced security
        WPF - 
            Windows presentation Foundation
            UI library with all animations , presentations and graphical design stuff
        WWF - 
            Windows Workflow Foundation
            gives diagramatic representation and programming of your project
        windows CardSpace (infocard)- 
            storing personal digital transactions securely
            Helps users select identity credentials (like a digital wallet) for transactions.
        
    Entity Framework - 
        ORM - object relational mapping
            library which passes records to database
    REST - 
        add, edit, delete information via API token

    ADO.NET - low level data access tech
        handles both relational and non relational database
    ASP.NET - 
        developing web applications and web APIs.
        Supports web controls, Razor pages
        offers SSR
    PLINQ - 
        linq - brought functional prog ideas into object oriented environment
        Parallel LINQ adds intuitive parallel execution capabilities onto linq
    LINQ-to-XML - 
        data extraction possible from DB, objects etc using LINQ
        allows extraction from any machine
        

LINQ architecture - 
    DIAGRAM
    makes concept of querying, a first class programming concept in c#
    data to be queried can be XML (linq to XML), databases (linq enabled ADO.NET : to datasets, to sql, to entities), and objects (linq to objects)
    highly extensible i.e  allows building custom linq enabled data providers (eg linq to amazon, to LDAP)

    Advantages of LINQ - 
        offers object based , language integrated way of querying data, irrespective of the data source
        compile time syntax checking
        allows querying collections like arrays, lists, collections, databases etc, in language of your application
            like vb or c#, in same way as you would query a database with SQL 
        strongly typed
        queries can be reused

    sytnax -
        linq provides language integrated syntax (called query syntax), similar to relational query langs like SQL.
            it provides shorthand for writing queries using LINQ query operators (from ... where.. select)
            its easier and more readable
            provides full compile time checking support
        in background, when c# encounters query syntax, it transforms it into method invocation code that uses Lambda expressions and extension methods
        eg - 
            query syntax : 
                var result = from s in students
                    where s.Age > 18
                    select s;
                here, each query must end with select or group by 
            method syntax (lambda) :
                var result = students.Where(s => s.Age > 18).Select(s => s);

    LINQ to ADO.NET - 
        deals with data from external sources, basically any source that ADO.NET can connect to (to datasets, to sql, to entities)
        any class that implements IEnumerable<T> or IQueryable<T> can be queried
        eg . 
            // LINQ to DataSet
            var results = from row in myDataTable.AsEnumerable()
                where row.Field<int>("Age") > 18
                select row;


String - 
    immutable sequence of characters in C#
    Any modification creates a new string object.

    methods - 
        ToLower
        Replace('', '')   // only char, case sensitive
        Equals()    // compares by value, not ever by reference
        CompareTo(), 1 if letters of og string are ahead than compare string (in terms of alphabetical or numerical)
        Contains // case sensitive
        EndsWith  // case sensitive
        IndexOf // case sensitive, str and char
        Insert(index, "")   // no char
        Remove(from, how_many)   // removes from i onwards , how_many number of chars
        Split()
        string.Join(',', s1) 


StringBuilder - 
    mutable string class in System.Text.
    Modifies the string in place (no new object).
    Ideal for frequent modifications

    using System.Text
    methods - 
        Equals()
        CompareTo(), 1 if letters of og string are ahead than compare string (in terms of alphabetical or numerical)
        Append()
        Replace('', '')   // only char, case sensitive
        Insert(index, "")   // no char
        Remove(from, how_many)   // removes from i onwards , how_many number of chars
        GetType
        ToString
        Clear



LINQ - 
    .Select()
    .Where()
    .OrderBy  // ascending | OrderByDescending
    .Count()
    .Any()   // returns boolean
    .All()
    .GroupBy()
    .Take() 

    using System.Ling
    using System.Xml.Linq


Arrays -
    continguous memory location
    accessed by index
    fast processing
    can store primitive as well as object datatypes

    int[] arr;    // declaration
    int[] arr = new int[5];    // {0,0,0,0,0} initially
    int[] arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
    int[] arr = new int[] {6,7,8,9,1};

    Types - 
        Mulit-dimensional -
            Rectangular arrays
            initialization of all rows & columns together (can’t initialize row by row later)
            fixed memory
            number of elements in each row is same
            access arr[i, j]
            its like matrix
            stored as continguous block of memory
            eg . 
                string [,] names = new string[2, 3]{
                    {1, 2, 3},
                    {4, 5, 6}
                };  // 2D
               
                int[ , , ] arr;   // 3D

                string [,] names = {
                    {1, 2, 3},
                    {4, 5, 6}
                };  // ??? can we do this 
                yes, compiler interprets dimensions

            
        Jagged arrays - 
            array of arrays
            have to initalize Each row separately
            flexible size i.e there can be unequal arrays in each row
            access arr[i][j]
            non-continguous storage
            eg . 
                int[][] arr1 = new int[2][]{     // works even without writing 2, compiler interprets
                    new int[] {3, 4},
                    new int[] {2, 5, 2}
                };

                or
                
                // int[][] arr;     -> error, have to initialize
                int[][] arr = new int[2][0];
                arr[0] = new int[]{1, 3, 4}; 
                arr[1] = new int[]{1, 3}; 

            must always first allocate the outer array, then initialize each inner array separately

            eg { {1, 0, 2}, {1, 3} }



ASP.NET with Database - 
    ASP.NET core application
    Add new folder named "Models"
    Add new .cs class Student.cs
    Get set methods for roll_no, course, name

    Create new folder in pages/ named students
    Tools -> NuGet Package manager -> download SwashBuckle
    Students folder -> right click -> Add -> Razor Page -> Razor Page with entity framework
    Tools -> NuGet Console -> 2 cmds -> add-migration "init data" &     update-database
    Run with http , not https


Razor Pages in C# -
    Introduces a page-focussed framework , 
    used to create cross-platform data driven server-side webpages with clean seperation of concerns
    Advantages - 6
        Supports cross-platform (deployable on windows, mac, unix)
        lightweight and flexible to build in any application
        works well with C#
        organized code behind pages (like asp.net web forms)
        razor pages are task specific (eg page handling Creation, deletion etc)
        Header and footer same across many pages, thus consistency

    Steps - 
        create new project (ASP.NET core web app)
        Pages Folder -> all razor page coding done here
            Create new folder in pages/ named students
            Tools -> NuGet Package manager -> download SwashBuckle
            Students folder -> right click -> Add -> Razor Page -> Razor Page with entity framework
        wwwroot -> all webpage elements (css, js)
        Shared/ - all files in here , will be used throughout the website (_Layout.cshtml, _ValidationScriptPartial)        
        Any CSHTML code has corresponding C# code for itself
        Index.cshtml is index page that appears when we run website
            @page says its a razor page
            @model Website.Pages.IndexModel is dependency injection
            logger -> library usefull for tracking the user, like who visited website etc   


Rest API architecture - 
    Representational State Transfer
    software architectural style that defines set of rules used for creating web services
    Allows requesting systems, to access and manipulate web resources , using uniform predefined set of rules

    Restful system consists of - 
        client who requests for the resources
        server who has the resource

    Architectural Constraints - 6
        Uniform Interface
           provides uniform way of acting with a given server (irrespective of device/application type)
        Stateless
            the necessary state to handle a request is contained within req itself, server shouldnt store anything related to that session
            all required information (to fulfill a request) must be included in the req (in headers, query params etc)
        Cacheable (response can be saved)
            every resp should include whther resp is cacheable or not, and for how much time it is Cacheable (at client side).
            usually responses of post request cannot be cached for safety
        Client-server
            should have client-server architecture
            client -> someone requesting resource and not concerned about data-storage or business logic
            server -> holds resources, not concerned with frontend UI
        Layered System
            needs to be of multiple layers, each layers doesnt know anything about any other layer
            lot of intermediate servers between client and end-server, they help improve availability by load-balancing
        Code on demand
            optional feature
            server can provide executable code to client
            eg. server-side scripts like JavaScript
    eg. 
        get details of rno 100
        >> http://localhost:7000/api/Students/100 Get
        
        update details of rno 100
        >> http://localhost:7000/api/Students/100 POST (or PUT)


Master page - 
    Its a layout having header , footer etc. Kind of a template
    Gives consistent UI i.e go to any page, header footer remains same
    created using JavaScript/CSS
    Gives centralized way of changing UI

    Components -
        Master Page - creating the common UI elements
                    .master extension
        Content Page - webpage that will use master page
        ContentPlaceholder - reserved area in master page, where webpage will come
        ContentControl - controls to be added on control page
    
    Steps - 
        Right Click -> Add -> select MasterPage
        Add menubar to masterpage (common for whole website)
        Add few content pages like default.aspx, about.aspx, content.aspx
        while adding content pages, 'use Master Page' should be selected

    Eg - 
        <Items>

Ajax in ASP.NET - 
    Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
    development technique used to create interactive & dynamic web applications
    No cross-browser pain, as AJAX works smoothly across modern browsers
    with it, webapps can retrieve data from server asynchronously, without reload

    ADV - 
        reduces traffic travels
        better interactivity and responsiveness
        serveral multipurpose features can be handled from single web page
    Disadv - 
        Search engines (google) cannot index ajax applications
        it is built-in JS, if user disables JS in browser, it wont work
        less security , as scripts are visible to clients
        cannot directly access server info with ajax

    $.ajax({
        type: "GET",
        url: 'Employee/GetEmpList',      //  Calls a C# method returning list of employees
        contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
        dataType: "json",
        success: function (response) {
            // Looping over employee list and display it
            $.each(response, function (index, emp) {
                $('#output').append('<p>Id: ' + emp.ID + '</p>' +
                                    '<p>Id: ' + emp.Name + '</p>');
            });
        },
        error: function (errorThrown) {
            alert("Error Text: " + errorThrown); // Display error message
        }
    });


Delegates - 
    Type safe function pointer
    used when working with large project and huge number of files
    similar to a function pointer in C or C++
    allows to encapsulate a reference to a method inside a delegate object
    behaves like a class and also as a method

    types -
        single cast delegate - refers to only a single method
        multicast delegate - refers to and thus fires off , multiple methods having same signature  

    Adv - 
        encapsulate method's call from caller
        improves maintainability of application
        used to call a method asynchronously

    steps - 
        string myfunc(string a, string b){}           // both have same signature (return type and paramters)
        string otherfunc(string p, string q){}         // both might have different purpose

        public delegate string Del(string s1, string s2);    // method behaviour
        // delegate has to have same signature as that of the methods
        
        // instance of this delegate can represent (point to) any of our two methods
        Del del_obj = new Del(myfunc);     // pointer to our 

        //usage 
        string result = del_obj("Hello", "world");    // this function mightve been called 100 times in a file
        // right now, its calling/pointing to myfunc()
        // if we want to change to otherfunc() , in entire file, we can do so in one line

        // Del del_obj += otherfunc;  // this wouldve worked as multi-cast, where, both functions would be called, in order of their definition above



session management(url rewriting, session, cookies, hidden form) - 
    mechanism used by web containers to store session information for a user accross multiple requests
    Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, every new request from a client is treated as independent.
    thus, Session management allows the server to recognize the same user across multiple requests.

    4 different techniques -
        cookies - 
            text files stored on client browser
            contains user ID, preferences etc
            sent with each request
            but, users can disable cookies

        hidden form fields - 
            hidden input fields in forms, store session data
            data sent to server only when form submitted
            but, only works with form submissions

        URL rewriting - 
            session info attached to url as paramters -> extracted by server to identify
            but, data becomes visible in url which is less secure
            eg 
                hello?  id=101        &  user=alex
                url  | param1 = value | param2 = value
        HTTPSession - 
            client's first request -> container generates unique session ID and sends back to client with response -> temporary session created
            with each subsequent request -> client sends session ID -> container identifies where request is coming from
            container uses this ID to retrieve stored data of that user -> associates session with the request

    Request Object (per request) - always new for each HTTP request
    Session object (per user) - Stores known, earlier data
    application object (global) - visible to all users, shared


ADO.NET disconnected architecture - 
    low level data access technology
    lets app connect to databases, fetch data, update data, etc.

    two ways to work - 
        Connected Architecture - Stay connected to the database while reading or writing data
            uses Connection , command etc objects
            ideal for reading data quickly and sequentially
            conenction to DB remains open while reading
            not good for scalability as connection has to stay open
        Disconnected Architecture - fetch once, store in memory, disconnect from DB. work offline with that data
            uses Dataset
            can update DB later when needed
            works offline
            but, uses more memory

            Dataset - in-memory database holding multiple tables
            DataTable - One table inside dataset
            DataRow - single row of info in a table
            Data Column - Doesnt contain actual data
                stores info such as Column data type, default value, length of col
            Data Relation - 
                Defines a relationship between two tables (like foreign key).
                eg - CustID col in Orders table refers to CustomerID col in Customer table
            Data View - 
                Provides a window onto a Data table
                its a filtered or sorted view of a table




System.Object 
    Equals(), GetHashCode(), ToString(), GetType()

    IEnumerable
        GetEnumerator(), 

        ICollection
            .Count, IsSynchronized, SyncRoot, .CopyTo()

            IList
                read only, fixed size, variable size
                isFixedSize(), Clear()

Data Structure - 
    System.Object - 
        it is base class of every type.
        All other types directly/indirectly derive from object class
        top most class
        Because of its position, .NET developers should have good knowledge of object class and its members
        every variable (int, array, custom class etc) can call methods from object
        
        with new() it always goes in heap , else, in stack
        String class overrides object class (.Equals of string compares by value)

        Methods - 
            object.Equals(object A, object B)
                compares by address
                eg - int n1 = 2; int n2 = 3
                    bool result = object.Equals(n1, n2);    // false
                    // for primitives i.e value types, it compares by value
                
                eg - string s1 = "aa"; string s2 = "aa";    // goes to stack
                    bool result = object.Equals(s1, s2);   // true (both pointing same place or ref)

                    string s1 = "aa"; string s2 = new string("aa")   // goes to heap
                    bool result = object.Equals(s1, s2);   // true , as even if reference different, .Equals() is now of string class here, thus it compares by value

            GetHashCode() - 
                Gives a numeric hash value for the object (Used in hash-based collections for quick lookups)

                object A = 4;
                object B = "test";
                object C = new Person(1, "anuj");
                A.GetHashCode(); // 4    (for integers, hashcode is the number itself)
                B.GetHashCode(); // (some number, depending on string)
                C.GetHashCode(); // 2418355 (same like in B) (diff for each Person obj)

            .ToString() - 
                Converts object to readable string
            .GetType() - 
                Returns the runtime type

        GetEnumerator() - 
            returns enumerable object that can be used to iterate through a collection. 
            Allows using foreach statement, for reading data in collection
            eg - 
                Array arr = new int[] {12, 24,36,48};
                IEnumerator enum = arr.GetEnumerator();

                string msg = "";
                while(enum.MoveNext()){
                    int n = (int) enum.Current;
                    msg += n.ToString() + "\n";
                }


        ICollection (extends IEnumerable)- 
            provides method for getting size of collection, creating enumerators, managing Synchronized access to all non generic 
            collections. It is a base interface for classes in the System.Collection namespace

            Properties
                Count - 
                    refers to number of elements contained by ICollection
                    eg - 
                        ArrayList arr_list = new ArrayList();
                        arr_list.Add(10);
                        arr_list.Add(20);
                        int count = arr_list.Count;   // 2
                IsSynchronized - 
                    returns true if access to ICollection is Synchronized
                    ie.if collection is thread-safe (only one thread can modify it at a time)
                    eg - 
                        reading from a file -> 3 people can read at same time
                        writing to a file -> only one at a time
                SyncRoot - 
                    returns an obj, which can be used to synchronize the access to ICollection
                CopyTo - 
                    Copies elements of ICollection object to any array starting at a particular index
                    eg - 
                        int[] sourceID = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5};
                        int[] destinationID = new int [sourceID.Length]
                        sourceID.CopyTo(destinationID, 0)

            System.Collection.IList (extends ICollection)- 
                IList interface represents collection of objects that can be individually accessed by Index
                Categories - 
                    readOnly - this IList cannot be modified
                    fixed size - doesnt allow addition or removal of elements, but allows modification of existing elements
                    variable size - allows addition, removal, modification
                
                Properties - 
                    isFixedSize - 
                        returns true if IList has fixed size
                    Clear() - 
                        removes all items from IList
                    .Count also works


MVC architecture - 
    software architecture used for developing user interfaces
    seperates application into 3 interconnected components (seperation of concerns) (easier to manage and test) - 
        Model (.cs) - 
            brains of application
            manages data, logic and business rules
            handles data access and manipulation as well as data validation (business rules)
            knows nothing about the view or controller (self contained)
        View (.cshtml) - 
            UI of application
            presents data to user
            displays data received from controller, sends user interactions (click, submit etc) to controller
            makes data LOOK good, doesnt process data; just displays
        controllers - 
            intermediary between model and View
            handles user input and flow of application
            receives user requests (HTTP GET), interacts with model to fetch or update data
            selects appropriate view and passes data to it
        thus, user -> controller -> model -> view -> user

        Adv - 
            Provides organized code by seperation of concerns
            Helps in concurrent development (diff developers can work simultaneosly on the 3 components)
            business logic in model and controller can be tested, independently of the UI
            same model can be used by multiple views, reducing code
